# SIEM Monitoring Lab ‚Äî Splunk Home Setup for Threat Detection

This project simulates SOC (Security Operations Center) activity using Splunk Cloud to monitor Apache web access logs. It demonstrates my ability to set up a SIEM dashboard, analyze log data for suspicious behavior, and detect potential threats such as reconnaissance, brute-force attempts, and geographic anomalies.

## üéØ Goal

To build a home SOC-style SIEM monitoring setup and showcase skills in log ingestion, SPL (Search Processing Language), threat hunting, detection use cases, and dashboarding ‚Äî using Splunk Cloud.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

| Tool         | Purpose                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Splunk Cloud | SIEM platform / dashboarding    |
| Apache Logs  | Simulated web log data source   |
| SPL          | Detection queries               |

## üîç Detection Use Cases Implemented

| Use Case                             | SPL Query (Simplified)                           |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Top Talkers (Most Active IPs)**    | `| stats count by clientip | sort -count | head 10` |
| **404 Error Scanners**               | `status=404 | stats count by clientip | sort -count | head 10` |
| **Top Requested URLs**               | `| stats count by uri_path | sort -count | head 10` |
| **Traffic Trends Over Time**         | `| timechart count span=1h`                      |
| **Geographic Outlier IPs**           | `| iplocation clientip ‚Ä¶ | stats count by Country` |
